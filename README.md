## Meaning of top_p and top_k

The parameters top_p and top_k in OpenAI and similar completion APIs control how the model generates responses, specifically by adjusting the randomness and diversity of the text generation.

### 1) top_k

Definition: Controls the number of top probable tokens considered at each step in the text generation.

Mechanism:

1)   At every generation step, the model assigns probabilities to all possible next tokens.
2)   top_k limits the choices to the top k tokens with the highest probabilities.
3)   The rest of the tokens (those outside the top k) are disregarded, even if their probabilities are non-zero.

Effect:

1)   A low top_k (e.g., 5) results in more deterministic outputs because only the most probable tokens are considered.
2)   A high top_k (e.g., 50 or 100) allows more randomness and diversity since the model can pick from a broader set of tokens.
3)   top_k = 0 (or not setting it) disables this constraint, and all tokens are considered.


### 2) top_p

Definition: A cumulative probability threshold that dynamically limits the pool of tokens considered for generation.

Mechanism:

1)  At each generation step, tokens are ranked by their probabilities.
2)  Starting from the highest probability token, tokens are added to the pool until the cumulative probability exceeds the threshold top_p.
3)  Tokens outside this pool are ignored, regardless of their individual probabilities.

Effect:

1)  A low top_p (e.g., 0.1) makes the generation very deterministic by only considering the most probable tokens.
2)  A high top_p (e.g., 0.9 or 1.0) allows more diversity by including less probable tokens in the sampling pool.
3)  top_p = 1.0 means all tokens are considered (equivalent to disabling top_p).

### Comparing top_k and top_p

top_k:

*  Uses a fixed number of tokens.
*  May exclude lower-ranked tokens even if their combined probabilities contribute significantly.

top_p:

*  Uses a dynamic number of tokens based on probability thresholds.
*  Ensures that the sampling pool adapts to the probability distribution at each step.

### Using top_k and top_p Together

Both parameters can be combined to fine-tune the randomness and diversity:

*  top_k sets a fixed cap on the number of tokens considered.
*  top_p further refines this selection by excluding tokens based on cumulative probability.

#### For example:

*  Setting top_k=50 and top_p=0.9 allows sampling from up to 50 tokens but only considers those contributing to 90% of the total probability.


### Practical Usage

1)  Higher top_k or top_p values:
    *  More diverse and creative responses.
    *  Useful for brainstorming or generating varied outputs.

2)  Lower top_k or top_p values:
    *  More deterministic and focused responses.
    *  Useful for tasks requiring precision or structured output.
